# Elm: Score counter app


This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## Available scripts
In the project directory you can run:
### `elm-app build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `elm-app start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `elm-app test`
Run tests with [node-test-runner](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner/tree/master)

You can make test runner watch project files by running:
```sh
elm-app test --watch
```

## Turning off Elm Debugger

To turn off Elm Debugger, set `ELM_DEBUGGER` environment variable to `false`

## Changing the base path of the assets in the HTML

By default assets will be linked from the HTML to the root url. For example `/css/style.css`.

If you deploy to a path that is not the root, you can change the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable to properly reference your assets in the compiled assets. For example: `PUBLIC_URL=./ elm-app build`.

## Changing the Page `<title>`

You can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from “Elm App” to anything else.

Note that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) is done without touching the HTML.

If you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API and [ports.](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html#ports)

## Adding a Stylesheet

This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:

### `main.css`

```css
body {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

### `index.js`

```js
import './main.css'; // Tell Webpack to pick-up the styles from base.css
```

In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.

You can put all your CSS right into `src/main.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.

## Adding Images and Fonts

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

By requiring an image in JavaScript code, you tell Webpack to add a file to the build of your application. The variable will contain a unique path to the said file.

Here is an example:

```js
import logoPath from './logo.svg'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image
import { Main } from './Main.elm';

Main.embed(
    document.getElementById('root'),
    logoPath // Pass image path as a flag for Html.programWithFlags
  );
```

Later on, you can use the image path in your view for displaying it in the DOM.

```elm
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ img [ src model.logo ] []
        , div [] [ text model.message ]
        ]
```

## Using the `public` Folder

### Changing the HTML

The `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](#changing-the-page-title).
The `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.

### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System

You can also add other assets to the `public` folder.

Note that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.
For example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).
This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

* Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
* Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
* Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.

However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.

Inside `index.html`, you can use it like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
```

Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.

When you run `elm-app build`, Create Elm App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.

In Elm code, you can use `%PUBLIC_URL%` for similar purposes:

```elm
// Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!
// Normally we recommend using `import`  and `Html.programWithFlags` for getting
// asset URLs as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.
img [ src "%PUBLIC_URL%/logo.svg" ] []
```

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:

```js
const logo = `<img src=${process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.svg'} />`;
```

Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:

* None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.
* Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.
* Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.

### When to Use the `public` Folder

Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.
The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:

* You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
* You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.
* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.

## Running Tests

Create Elm App uses [elm-test](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner) as its test runner.

### Dependencies in Tests

To use packages in tests, you also need to install them in `tests` directory.

```bash
elm-app test --add-dependencies elm-package.json
```

## Deployment


`elm-app build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

### Static Server

For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```sh
serve -h
```
